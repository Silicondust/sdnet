This codebase provides APIs for building network based embedded systems.
Features include UPNP (SSDP/SOAP/GENA).

Linux: apps can be compiled as "init", eliminating the need for a filesystem,
shell, or any user-space environment. This yields a security advantage and
a size advantage.

Cross-platform: apps can be compiled to run under Windows, Mac, Linux, and/or
FreeBSD.
