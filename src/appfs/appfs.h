/*
 * Appfs is a mechanism to put files inside the executable that can be retreived and used by the app.
 *
 * Files are stored in a tar container which is linked into the executable as binary data. The appfs
 * apis process the embedded tar data to locate and return the requested file data.
 *
 * The tar archive must be creared with the "--format ustar" option and the "-b 1" option.
 *
 * Performance: the current implementation does not index the tar file - each time a file is requested
 * (open or mmap) the tar data is walked until the requested file is found or the end is reached.
