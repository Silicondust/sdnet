/*
 * A webclient represents a single tcp or tls connection to one server at a time.
 * A webclient_operation represents a GET or a POST operation.
 *
 * Any number of webclient_operations can be enqueued for the webclient to execute and operations can be to different servers.
 * If the server supports connection pipelining and the next request is to the same server (dns name) the webclient will
 * automatically pipeline the request.
 *
 * Redirects are automatically followed. Redirects can be to the same server or to a different server.
 * Note: as any operation could result in a redirect to a different server the next operation isn't pipelined until the headers have
 * been received from the first operation.
 *
 * If a failure occurs after a pipelined operation has been sent to the server but before the server has responded the webclient will
 * automatically reconnect and resubmit the operation.
 *
 * Once all operations have been completed the webclient will keep the the connection alive for a specified period of time in case of
 * future operations.
