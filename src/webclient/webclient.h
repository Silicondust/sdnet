/*
 * A webclient_connection represents a single tcp or tls connection to a webserver. It will automatically connect
 * and disconnect as needed.
 *
 * A webclient_operation represents a GET or a POST operation.
 *
 * On first operation the webclient_connection will connect to the server specified by the operation url.
 *
 * If a redirect response is received the webclient_connection will follow the redirect. This may require it to disconnect from
 * the current server and connect to a new server.
 *
 * A second operation can be accepted by the same webclient if:
 * - all prior operations have completed, OR
 * - the prior operation is in the data state AND the connection is not scheduled to be closed AND the dns_name in the url is the same.
 *
 * A new operation can be to a new server if all prior operations have been completed. It will only be rejected if a prior operation
 * is ongoing and the new operation can't be pipeliend behind it (or it is unknown if it can be pipelined behind it due to not being in
 * the data state).
